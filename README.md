# The Tech Book Repository

This repository is a curated collection of *must-read* books for programmers, developers and anyone interested in a good tech book. 
The idea behind this is to put the many lists of book recommendations into one handy repository, with the goal to make you a more proficient programmer. 
You'll find only books that other developers found truly inspiring - or that have been become timeless classics.

## Structure

Books in each category *(if applicable, sub-categories were added to main category)* are cataloged by:

    - author(s)
    - year and # of edition (if indicated)
    
To get a glimpse of what the book is about and to find out whether this is suitable for you, the following information is added:

    - Short Description what the book is all about and why it's recommended / what makes it so valuable

For easy purchasing a link to amazon.com *(for the time being only the US version)* is added:
