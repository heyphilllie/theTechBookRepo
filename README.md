# theTechBookRepo

## In a Nutshell
A miscellany of must-read books for programmers - developers and anyone interested in a good tech book.

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only books that other developers found truly inspiring - or that have been become timeless classics.

Books in each category are cataloged by categroy, title, author, edition, and year of publication. If applicable, sub-categories are added to main category.

    - Titel
    - Author
    - Edition
    - Year
    - Link to amazon.com

For easy purchasing a link to amazon.com *(for the time being only the US version)* is added. 

**TL;DR Click [here](books.md) to take a shortcut and browse through the books that already have been submitted.**

## The Idea

The idea is to summarize the most recommended books in tech into one repository. From decentralized lists all over the 
web to centralized list (web app) with still keeping it as simple as possible.

**On the technical side**
 
- Github Repository to store the data and make contributions easy
    - Contributing / submitting a book via PR
- web page hosted on GitHub *(for the time being)*
- using a static site generator to update the front end 
- integrating Solr as a built-in search

**On the front end side**

- displaying books with basic info (as mentioned in the intro)
- organized through categories / sub-categories
- filter 
- search 
- displaying ***badges / tags*** like 
    - Advanced
    - Aimed for Beginners (with no prior knowledge)
    - Beginner-Friendly
    - Written by Women/Woman
    - Timeless Classic
    - Theory-Only
    - With Practical Exercises
    - Glossary / comprehensive work, introduction
- link to amazon.com for easy purchasing

**Future Feature Ideas**

- Login via GitHub or Twitter
- save as Books as Favorite and/or Wanna-Reads and/or Have-Read
- recommend books (Upvoting)
