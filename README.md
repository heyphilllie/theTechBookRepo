# The Tech Book Repository
This repository is a curated collection of *must-read* books for programmers, developers and anyone interested in a good tech book. 
The idea is to summarize the most recommended books in tech into one repository. From decentralized lists all over the 
web to centralized list (web app) with still keeping it as simple as possible.

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient programmer. You'll find only books that other developers found truly inspiring - or that have been become timeless classics.

**TL;DR**

This page is not meant to be complete. We are trying to keep the balance between light and not too overwhelming but yet comprehensive.

The selection of book is opinionated.
