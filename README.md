## The Introduction
A curated collection of must-read books for programmers - developers and anyone interested in a good tech book.

**TL;DR Click [here](books.md) to take a shortcut and browse through the books that already have been submitted.**

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only books that other developers found truly inspiring - or that have been become timeless classics.

Books in each category are cataloged by categroy, title, author, edition, and year of publication. If applicable, sub-categories are added to main category.

## The Idea

The idea is to summarize the most recommended books in tech into one repository. From decentralized lists all over the 
web to centralized list (web app) with still keeping it as simple as possible.
 
We are using this Github Repository to store the data and make contributions easy. **For contribution details see the [contribution file](contribution.md).** 


## The Vision

We're thinking about building a wep app around this Repository. I mean, seriously, who doesn't like a fancy-schmancy web app?! 
And more important, who doesn't like creating a web app?!
