# The Tech Book Repository

This repository is a curated collection of *must-read* books for programmers, developers and anyone interested in a good tech book. 
The idea behind this is to put the many lists of book recommendations into one handy repository, with the goal to make you a more proficient programmer. 
You'll find only books that other developers found truly inspiring - or that have been become timeless classics. 

**TLDR** 

:point_right: Click **[here](books.md)** to take a shortcut and browse through the books that already have been submitted.


## Structure

Books in each category *(if applicable, sub-categories were added to main category)* are cataloged by 

  - title 
  - author(s)
  - year and # of edition (if indicated)
    
To get a glimpse of what the book is about and to find out whether this is suitable for you, 
the following information is added

  - Short Description what the book is all about and why it's recommended / what makes it so valuable

For easy purchasing a link to amazon.com *(for the time being only the US version)* is added.

Please keep in mind, that the selection of books is opinionated and that this list is far from being complete and more of a constant work in progress, 
which is updated continuously. :boom:

## Vision for the future

We're thinking about building a wep app based on this repository. I mean, seriously, who doesn't like a fancy-schmancy web app?! 
And more important, who doesn't like creating a web app?! :smirk:
