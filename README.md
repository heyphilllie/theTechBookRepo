# theTechBookRepo
A miscellany of must-read books in Tech, for programmers, developers and managers.

Books in each category are cataloged by titel, author, and year of publication. If applicable, sub-categories are added to main category.

    - Titel
    - Author
    - Edition
    - Year
    - Link to amazon.com

For easy purchasing a link to amazon.com *(for the time being only the US version)* is added. 

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only resources that other developers found truly inspiring - or that have been become timeless classics.

## The Idea

From decentralized lists to centralized list, still as simple as possible

Technically:
 
- Github repository
- Submitting book via Pull requests
- hosted on GitHub *(for the time being)*
- using a static site generator to update the front end 
- SOLR or similar

User Interface:

- displaying books with basic info plus and description
- organized through categories / sub-categories
- filter 
- search 
- descripion like recommended best for *xxx*
- link to amazon for easy purchasing

Feature Ideas for Future Updates: 

- Login via GitHub or Twitter
- save as favorite / wanna-reads
- recommend books
