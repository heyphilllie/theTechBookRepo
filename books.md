## 1. Coding in General & Programming Paradigms

#### The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master

Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, this book illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development.
It's an enlightening and timeless advice about doing your job as a software developer, ideas written in 1999 still relevant today. It forces you to revisit those basic fundamental topics with a very different perspective.

#### Programming Pearls

With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley's pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. 
This work is an all-time classic, highly valued by programmers at every level of experience, and often described as one of the most influentiual books read in a programmer's career.

#### Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This book has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade.
To anyone not sure of what this stands for, it is Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs and is a very good read for those looking to learn about computer science. It does require commitment in that it is not a book you rush through, rather you take your time and make sure you understand it bit by bit - but worth it because it makes sure you get a solid foundation of cs knowledge.

#### The Art of Computer Programming (Volumes 1-4)

The bible of all fundamental algorithms and the work that taught many of today’s software developers most of what they know about computer programming.
Whatever your background, if you need to do any serious computer programming, you will find your own good reason to make each volume in this series a readily accessible part of your scholarly or professional library. Countless readers have spoken about the profound personal influence of Knuth’s work, and admire Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books.

#### The C++ Programming Language

The new C++11 standard allows programmers to express ideas more clearly, simply, and directly, and to write faster, more efficient code. Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, has reorganized, extended, and completely rewritten his definitive reference and tutorial for programmers who want to use C++ most effectively.
It's considered a classic, though it serves to introduce the language (and preferably, the rationale behind it) to someone who is already familiar with computer programming.

### 5.6 GO
### 5.7 JavaScript
#### JavaScript: The Good Parts

This is a book about the JavaScript programming language. It is intended for programmers who, by happenstance or curiosity, are venturing into JavaScript for the first time. It is also intended for programmers who have been working with JavaScript at a novice level and are now ready for a more sophisticated relationship with the language. JavaScript is a surprisingly powerful language. Its presents some challenges, but being a small language, it is easily mastered. 
It's a great book that will bring your understanding of JS from intermediate to the beginnings of expert.
